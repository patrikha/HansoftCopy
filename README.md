# HansoftCopy

Command line utility for copying column data within a [Hansoft](http://hansoft.com) project. For a simple setup have a look at the [Hansoft docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/patrikha/hansoftserver/).
For help please use the build-in help command: HansoftCopy --help

Supported platforms are OSX and Linux.

Caveat:
* Supports only custom columns.
* Simple type column definitions, like text/number.
* Single choice drop down menus.
